# This is a repo for storing all the exercises from the 'Objects First with Java' textbook my OO programming course uses. 
# This repo was set up as a way to learn to use git, and keep my projects accessible across devices.
# Practially all the code present here was created by David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling, the authors of "Objects first with Java: A practical introduction using Bluej".
